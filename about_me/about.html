      <h3>About Me</h3>

    <p>I'm a Memphis native circling back to the Bluff City after 
          living in the Carolinas.</p>
    <p>I'm a veteran of the United States Army with two combat 
        deployments. Serving my country has been my passion for 
        the last decade.</p>
    <p>Recently, I unleashed my inner sci-fi geek, which means if I'm not 
        at work or the gym or running a weekend 5k, I am probably
        deep into another Star Trek novel or old Stargate episode. </p>

    <h3>Chris 2.0</h3>

    <p>After my last deployment in 2012, I worked towards a bachelor's
        degree in Public Relations with the end goal of going back
        into the Army as an officer</p>
    <p>However, a shoulder injury derailed those plans, so I am working 
        to combine my passion of layout and design to break into 
        the field of web design, front-end development, or something  
        in between.</p>
    <p>I am completely new to CS concepts, coding and everything in between, 
        but I'm up for the challenge. And away we go...</p>
